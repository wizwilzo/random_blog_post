        <h2>Reading my blog has never been easier</h2>
        <p>
            I made this tool so that others can look back on my old posts easily. It utilizes the blogger API to generate all the post URLs so I don't have to do that myself. Just press the button as many times as you would like!

            <button name="getRandomPostButton" type = "submit">Click me</button>
        </form>
        URL: <a href="{{ blog_url }}">{{blog_url}}</a>
